# Seeing quality predictor
Seeing refers to the degradation of the image of an astronomical object due to turbulence in the atmosphere of Earth. This project is a fully automated workflow designed to 
1) Builds a labeled seeing-quality dataset. I report seeing quality (1-5) through a discord bot. The bot automatically collects matching weather data from Open-Meteo API. Each rating becomes a new training example.
2) Predicts seeing quality based on current weather conditions upon request. The trained model estimates expected seeing based on live weather data. Useful for planning observing sessions or understanding atmospheric effects.
